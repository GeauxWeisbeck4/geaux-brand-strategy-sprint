# About Andrew and Geaux Brand Strategy

I am a full stack developer and entrepreneur in Raleigh, North Carolina. I love programming and it has helped me channel my creative engergies into something very productive. I currently have a digital agency I run called Tar Heel Dev Studio and it will be the focus of this Section 4 Brand Strategy sprint. 

The Brand Strategy sprint is my 7th Section 4 Sprint that I have participated in and 6th I will complete. I have needed this sprint really badly and also have been very excited to have my second sprint with [Prof G, aka Scott Galloway](https://profgmedia.com/). I would like to have a clear brand strategy leaving this sprint so I can really hit the ground running with my studio after this.

# Geaux Section 4 Hub

I am also working on sort of a home base for all of my Section 4 sprints and will also invite sprint participants to join the hub. It will link to my websites plus have more sprint like features for best practices when participating in a sprint. The [page can be found here](https://geauxsection4.netlify.app) and may not look super finished when you first check it out. 

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions at andrew@tarheeldevstudio.com or fill out the contact form on this website!
