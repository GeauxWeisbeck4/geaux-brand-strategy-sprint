Welcome to Geaux Brand Strategy, my website for the Section 4 Brand Strategy sprint with Scott Galloway. This is my 7th sprint I have done and it is the one I have been looking the most forward to. Follow along with my sprint and check out my blog each day to stay up to date!

# Introduction

As I mentioned, I have been looking forward to this sprint all year since I signed up for it a while ago. I need to take my brand Tar Heel Dev Studio and lay out a clear brand strategy to start actually generating some new business. I feel I have been sort of directionless with this brand so I can't wait for the work this sprint will bring.

There isn't much else I can say in this introduction sprint that you can't find on the website, so have a look around! Don't hesitate to reach out via form if you have any questions on the website contact form!
