I have been looking forward to this Section 4 sprint for quite some time now. I can't remember exactly when I signed up for the Brand Strategy Sprint, but I remember it was the first one I knew I would take with Scott Galloway - a person I definitely look up to. 

# Brand Strategy Sprint - Day One 
Aside from all of this awesome information I'll be digesting and sharing with y'all, there is a whole other element I want to share and educate people on this time through the sprint - it's the actual *sprinting*, or in other words, the workflow that I used to efficiently work through the sprint while trying to implement new features to products that I use in my sprint. 

This time it will be VERY VERY beneficial as I get to bring in Tar Heel Dev Studio. THDS is my digital agency that I have had good ideas for, and got an ok start to it. I just wasn't consistent and got too stressed out to figure out how to put all of the pieces together. This sprint will help me establish a brand identity and work to strengthen it - remember this: The brand is the way you make your customer feel about your business esentially. 

# Sprint Workflow 
I will dedicate better resources than just a blog post, but I will be having these daily blog posts with nicely written blog posts that look better than my sprint notes and coding notes. 

## TO DO
- [ ] Fill out code buddy form for Gabe
- [ ] Introduce myself
- [ ] Actual developing of website - get started
- [ ] Get familiar with Slack
- [ ] Set up sprint workflow

## Notes 
I use [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so) with VS Code which I can't recommend enough. You can check out my [digital garden](https://dendrondigitalgarden.netlify.app) here.

Here are some alternatives:
- Foam
- LogSeq
- Obsidian 
- Notion 
- Roam 

I'll add them to my resources pages. 

## Kanban Boards, Tables, Etc. 
- [GeauxWeisbeck4 GitHub](https://github.com/geauxweisbeck4): The most important tool to any developer is their git flow and GitHub is like a super productive social media account for that. I track some of my sprint stuff there and on Gitkraken, my favorite Git GUI.
- Trello: I'll get my trello stuff on here later on too.

# It's about 12:30 AM as I finish this post
So I need to wrap it up. I'll get more into my workflow, resources and more as I go on, but today was heavily about preparing everything and getting set up to be successful for this sprint!
